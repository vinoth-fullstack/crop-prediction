Crop Prediction System
This project is a machine learning-based crop prediction system developed using Python. The system predicts the best crops to plant based on various environmental factors.

Prerequisites
Anaconda (Python 3.8+)
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (listed below)


Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-prediction-system.git
cd crop-prediction-system


Create a new Anaconda environment:


conda create --name crop-prediction python=3.8
conda activate crop-prediction
Install the required libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application


Navigate to the project directory in Anaconda:


cd path/to/crop-prediction-system


Run the application:


python web.py


Open the application in your web browser:

After running the command above, you will get a localhost URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000). Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser to access the Crop Prediction System.
